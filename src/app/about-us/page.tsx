      <p className="mb-6">
        <strong>At Auralix AI, we believe that top-tier AI solutions should be accessible—not exclusive.</strong> Founded right here in Nova Scotia, our mission is simple: empower local restaurants, cafes, and small businesses to harness AI for smarter growth, better customer experiences, and increased competitiveness. Instead of outsourcing automation, tedious workflows, or analytics to high-priced vendors, owners can do it themselves— intelligently.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        The spark for Auralix AI ignited when we, two Computer Science graduates from Dalhousie University, noticed a gap: small business owners were being left behind in the automation revolution. Large firms were streamlining operations with AI, while unique community brands were grappling with manual processes and outdated tech. Motivated to bridge that divide, we co-founded Auralix AI—with you in mind.
